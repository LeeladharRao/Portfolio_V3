### I'm Leela!, software engineer, who loves to fiddle with software.
<br>

Hey, I'm a software engineer from India, and I use data to make the world a better place. This is my place on the web that I've created to show the world.

By trade, I am a Automation developer. I build and write scripts to automate softwares and also have done a bit of web designing work too. Along my way, I've picked up enough related tech to handle frontend, backend, database administration, and even a touch of design.

If you too love programming or just want to talk about nerdy things, you can contact me by email at <strong> kompallyleeladhar@gmail.com</strong>. I always appreciate meeting new people.


## Hobbies.

There's a whole world out there outside of tech, but coding is my favorite hobby. I am pretty much open-minded towards all things, you can talk to me about anything and everything.
I love cooking, playing and watching football and l love motorsports.

I like strategy and indie video games. Science, science fiction, animation stuff, Pokemon's, modern engineering technology interests me, and I love binge-watching web content.
